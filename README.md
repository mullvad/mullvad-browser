# Mullvad Browser

The Mullvad Browser is a privacy-focused web browser developed in a collaboration between [Mullvad VPN](https://mullvad.net) and the [Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org). It’s designed to minimize tracking and fingerprinting. You could say it’s a Tor Browser to use without the Tor Network. Instead, you can use it with a trustworthy VPN. The idea is to provide one more alternative – beside the Tor Network – to browse the internet with more privacy. To get as many people as possible to fight the big data gathering of today. To free the internet from mass surveillance.
